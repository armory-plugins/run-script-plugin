# run-script-plugin

_Note: This plugin is under active development and subject to change. Use with caution until there has been
a 1.0 release._

The `run-script-plugin` provides Spinnaker with a preconfigured job stage that allows the opperator to run a custom script. This is useful if you need to run an arbitrary script and use the output as part of your pipeline.
